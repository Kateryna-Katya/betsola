            <p>So there's this guy Harry, right? Old fisherman with this absolutely insane handlebar mustache - I'm talking
            cartoon-level ridiculous here. Seriously, it's like something out of a cartoon. Guy's been using the same rusty old boat
            forever, completely obsessed with this one fish he named 'the Scatter' - don't ask me why. Half the time you'll find him
            napping by the dock with his line in the water, probably having another dream about his big catch.</p>
            <p>But then - SPLASH! - something huge moves down there in the water. Harry's eyes go wide because he swears he just saw
            his white whale swimming right there. It’s what keeps the old guy motivated.</p>
